### Specifications:

- Fixed Supply: 10,000,000
- LP will be immediately burned - time/date TBD.
- LP Pairing: SHIBC/KNGR
- LP Ratio: 0.1% SHIBC supply : 100% KNGR supply = 100b SHIBC* : 10m KNGR <sup>* (100b SHIBC has a 10-12.5 ETC value at the time of writing)</sup>

### Rationale/s and Concepts:

- 10mil multiplied by 10mil = 100 trillion = SHIBC supply.
- SHIBC was burned with ETC - SHIBC will always be a means to burning ETC. KINGR is born in the same light.
- Open democratised and decentralised are at the core. What belongs to Kingers-KNGR, will belong to the community.

If it isn't here, it isn't real - anything else is a counterfeit so give it the middle Kinger.
