### Specifications:

- Supply: 10,000,000
- LP Pairing: SHIBC/KNGR
- LP Ratio: 0.1% SHIBC supply : 100% KNGR supply = 100b SHIBC : 10m KNGR 
* (100b SHIBC has a 10-12.5 ETC value at the time of writing)
- LP will be immediately burned.
- More details soon.

### Rationale/s and Concepts:

- 10mil multiplied by 10mil = 100 trillion = SHIBC supply.
- SHIBC was burned with ETC - SHIBC will always be a means to burning ETC. KINGR is born in a similar light.
- Open democratised and decentralised are at the core. What belongs to Kingers-KNGR, will belong to the community.
